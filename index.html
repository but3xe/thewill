<p>As a black man growing up in America, I always felt like I was out of place until I got to college. When I first entered school, I found a video game club called the nerd cave and knew I had found my place. This was the spot to be for me during those first two years of classes and nowadays when I work 50-60 hour weeks at work I find myself missing that place. Wishing I had somewhere I feel like I could go and feel comfortable.</p> <br>

<p>Hip-Hop: One of the greatest things ever created and truly the most diverse genre of music or category of any art. When I am empty I have hip-hop, when I'm full I have hip-hop, when I'm sad it's there, and even when I'm not thinking of it there it goes. Affecting all people more than they know even if they claim to not listen to it. Your favorite artist was influenced by it and all new artists try and copy it. One of the best to ever do it was Nujabes, a Japanese hip-hop producer and collaborator who is responsible for the lofi music movement and what allows most Gen Z and Millenials to feel comfortable falling asleep or relaxing.</p><br>
